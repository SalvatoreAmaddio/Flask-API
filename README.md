# Flask RESTful API
The assessment is a back-end-only Python application by Flask that runs on the web.
The application interrogates a local MySQL database through API endpoints, which
allow data fetching and all CRUD operations. To protect the endpoints from
unauthorised access, a JSON Web Token system has been implemented. The session's
timeout is 30 minutes.
